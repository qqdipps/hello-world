# hello-world
Hello, world! My first repository...

Coding and programming is **exhilarating**. 
## I've taught my self python and in process of learning Java. 
# update: ruby in progress, rails soon to follow
#### Next up: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, ~Ruby, RubyonRails~  

I'm new to the field, but
# WOWza its _amazing_!!!!   
  * Every time my code compiles and runs I Soar.   
  * Every error is a foe to be slain and I **CHARGE** into battle with my head held high.  
  

Learning new things can be intimidating,   
  but by taking the first steps, we power through the discomfort
  
  to the otherside, where...  
    feelings of joy & empowerment reside!
    
I am working on:  
* file management  
* not only using web IDEs
* code structure and design patterns
* data science
