# hello-world
Hello, world! My first repository...

Coding and programming is **exhilarating**. 
## I've taught my self python and in process of learning Java -> studying for OCAJP and taking night class. 
# update: ruby in progress -> solving easy coding challenges, rails in progress -> building blog
#### Next up: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, ~Ruby, RubyonRails~  

I'm new to the field, but
# WOWza its _amazing_!!!!   
  * Every time my code compiles and runs I Soar.   
  * Every error is a foe to be slain and I **CHARGE** into battle with my head held high.  
  

Learning new things can be intimidating,   
  but by taking the first steps, we power through the discomfort
  
  to the otherside, where...  
    feelings of joy & empowerment reside!
    
I am working on:  
* file management -- current project committing as I go and using github for file managment of recent projects
* not only using web IDEs-- yes now using eclipse for java and text editor sublime and iTerm2 w/ zsh
* code structure and design patterns- Implementing psuedocode, designing code to handle corner cases, learning about design patterns.
* data / computer science -- learned about binary searching and how to compare alogrithms (thanks geeks for geeks), focusing on data structures and algorithms, and solving easy [coding challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com)
